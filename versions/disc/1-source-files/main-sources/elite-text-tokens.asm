\
\ This source file produces the following binary file:
\
\   * WORDS.bin
\
\ This gets loaded as part of elite-loader3.asm and gets moved to &0400 during
\ the loading process.
\
\ The binary file also includes the sine and arctan tables, so the three parts
\ end up as follows:
\
\   * Recursive token table:    QQ18 = &0400 to &07FF
\   * Sine lookup table:        SNE  = &07C0 to &07DF
\   * Arctan lookup table:      ACT  = &07E0 to &07FF
