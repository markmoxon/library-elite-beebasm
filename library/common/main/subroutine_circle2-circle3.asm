\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw a circle with the centre at (K3, K4) and radius K. Used to draw the
\ planet and the chart circles.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   STP                 The step size for the circle
\
\   K                   The circle's radius
\
\   K3(1 0)             Pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the circle
\
\   K4(1 0)             Pixel y-coordinate of the centre of the circle
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              The C flag is clear
