\    Summary: Print the selected system's adjective, e.g. Lavian for Lave
\  Deep dive: Extended text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The adjective for the current system is generated by taking the system name,
\ removing the last character if it is a vowel, and adding "-ian" to the end,
\ so:
\
\   * Lave gives Lavian (as in "Lavian tree grub")
\
\   * Leesti gives Leestian (as in "Leestian Evil Juice")
\
\ This routine is called by jump token 17, {system name adjective}, and it can
\ only be used when justified text is being printed - i.e. following jump token
\ 14, {justify} - because the routine needs to use the line buffer to work.
